\section{Introduction}

\section{A Unit Test box}
\label{sec:unitbox}

Tests are written in pure Prolog and enclosed within the directives
begin_tests/1 and end_tests/1. They can be embedded inside a normal
source module, or be placed in a seperate test-file that loads the files
that must be tested. Code inside a test box is normal Prolog code. The
entry points are defined by rules using the head \term{test}{Name} or
\term{test}{Name, Options}, where \arg{Name} is a ground term and
\arg{Options} is a list describing additional properties of the test.
Here is a very simple example:

\begin{code}
:- begin_tests(lists).
:- use_module(library(lists)).

test(member) :-
	member(a, [a]).

:- end_tests(lists).
\end{code}

The second argument of the test-head defines additional processing
options.  Defined options are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{blocked}{+Reason:atom}
The test is currently disabled.   Tests are flagged as blocked if they
are known not to work but this accepted as something that must be fixed
in the future.
\end{description}
